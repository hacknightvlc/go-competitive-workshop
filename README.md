# fly-pokeapi

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to help you learn [Go](https://go.dev/) by building a CLI tool that interacts with the [PokÃ©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/). With this tool, you should be able to execute the following commands:

`fly-pokeapi pokemon <name>`:  Name must be mandatory. This command gets the detail of a pokemon and prints a table in the terminal output containing the name of the PokÃ©mon, its types, and its abilities.

*Example output:*

|   Name    |        Types         |                   Abilities                   |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Bulbasaur | Grass, Poison        | Overgrow, Chlorophyll                         |



`fly-pokeapi attack`: Use this command to group the first 9 PokÃ©mon by type and sort them by their attack power. Emojis representing each type (ðŸ”¥ ðŸŒµ ðŸ’§) should be used.

*Example output:*

ðŸ”¥ Fire:
|   Pokemon   | Attack |
|-------------|--------|
| Charizard   |   84   |
| Charmander  |   52   |
| Charmeleon  |   64   |

ðŸŒµ Grass:
|   Pokemon   | Attack |
|-------------|--------|
| Venusaur    |   82   |
| Bulbasaur   |   49   |
| Ivysaur     |   62   |

ðŸ’§ Water:
|   Pokemon   | Attack |
|-------------|--------|
| Blastoise   |   83   |
| Squirtle    |   48   |
| Wartortle   |   63   |

`fly-pokeapi stats`: This command creates a CSV file containing the first 9 PokÃ©mon and their evolutionary chain. Additionally, it groups and sums up the each stat belonging to each PokÃ©mon.

```csv
